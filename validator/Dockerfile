# This stage builds the TypeScript source code into JavaScript.
FROM base as builder

# First, copy over package files and install all dependencies.
# This includes devDependencies needed for the build process (e.g., typescript).

RUN npm install

# Then, copy over the rest of the source code and build the project.
# The .dockerignore file will prevent node_modules on the host from being copied.

# ---- Production Stage ----
# This stage creates the final, lean image for running the application.
FROM base as runner

# Copy package.json and install *only* production dependencies.
# This avoids including devDependencies in the final image, keeping it small.
